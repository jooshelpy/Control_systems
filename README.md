# MIA Task 7

### Tasks describtion:
1. Task one
    - Controling a DC Brushed Motor using Cytron with Arduino.
    - Implementing a software soft start filter using Exponential smoothing Filter.
2. Task two
    - Implementing a PID control system that controls the cleaning rate of a suction mechanism.
3. Task three
    - Driving the Kinematic model for Three omni-directional wheels configuration.
    - Creating a Python Simulation of the       movement of that robot that includes:
        - Taking (Vx, Vy, omega) and returning the angular velocity on each motor.
        - Driving each motor using a Cytron driver.
        - Creating positional PID Control that takes the target position and executes an instruction to got to this position.
