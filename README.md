## Code descitption

Implementing PID 

**Proportional**

```arduino
float p_cur_val = kp * error;
```

Integration

```arduino
float i_cur_val = ki * (error + e_last_val) / 2.0 * time_delay;
```

**Derivative**

```arduino
float d_cur_val = kd * (error - e_last_val) / time_delay;
```

Adding 3 values to get the old current value and print it to serial
